/**
 * Problem 2: My Calendar I (Non-overlapping Intervals)
 * Goal: Design a class to book events that do not overlap. Each event is a pair [start, end).
 *
 * Solution using TreeMap:
 * We store existing bookings in a TreeMap<Integer, Integer>, where key is start time and value is end time.
 * Logic:
 * For each booking, check:
 * the floor entry (event that starts before or at the same time): does its end time overlap?
 * the ceiling entry (event that starts right after): does this start before the current event ends?
 * */
