A Map is an object that maps keys to values. A map cannot contain duplicate keys: Each key can map to at most one value.
It models the mathematical function abstraction. The Map interface includes methods for
basic operations
(such as put, get, remove, containsKey, containsValue, size, and empty),
bulk operations
(such as putAll and clear),
and collection views (such as keySet, entrySet, and values).

The Java platform contains three general-purpose Map implementations:
-HashMap;
-TreeMap;
-LinkedHashMap;
Their behavior and performance are precisely analogous to HashSet, TreeSet, and LinkedHashSet.
