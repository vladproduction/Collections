A Set is a Collection that cannot contain duplicate elements.
It models the mathematical set abstraction. The Set interface contains only methods inherited from Collection
and adds the restriction that duplicate elements are prohibited.

Set also adds a stronger contract on the behavior of the equals and hashCode operations, allowing Set instances
to be compared meaningfully even if their implementation types differ. Two Set instances are equal if they contain
the same elements.

The Java platform contains three general-purpose Set implementations:
-HashSet;
-TreeSet;
-LinkedHashSet;
