A Set is a Collection that cannot contain duplicate elements.
It models the mathematical set abstraction. The Set interface contains only methods inherited from Collection
and adds the restriction that duplicate elements are prohibited.

Set also adds a stronger contract on the behavior of the equals and hashCode operations, allowing Set instances
to be compared meaningfully even if their implementation types differ. Two Set instances are equal if they contain
the same elements.

The Java platform contains three general-purpose Set implementations:
-HashSet;
-LinkedHashSet;
-TreeSet;

Set:
    1) unique
    2) no index access
    3) has no order

 HashSet:
    1) unique - define as equals/hashCode

 LinkedHashSet:
    1) unique - define as equals/hashCode
    3) has order

 TreeSet:
    1) unique - define as Comparator -1, 0 ,1
    4) supports sorting (only for TreeSet)

Set - interface
 Here are next implementations:
    1) HashSet
    2) LinkedHashSet
    3) TreeSet
 Set set = new HashSet();
 Set set = new LinkedHashSet();
 Set set = new TreeSet()
