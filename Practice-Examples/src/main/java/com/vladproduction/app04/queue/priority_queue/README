important points on Priority Queue are as follows: 

*PriorityQueue doesn’t permit null.
*We can’t create a PriorityQueue of Objects that are non-comparable
*PriorityQueue are unbound queues.
*The head of this queue is the least element with respect to the specified ordering. If multiple elements are tied for the
least value, the head is one of those elements — ties are broken arbitrarily.
*Since PriorityQueue is not thread-safe, java provides PriorityBlockingQueue class that implements the BlockingQueue
interface to use in a java multithreading environment.
*The queue retrieval operations poll,  remove,  peek, and element access the element at the head of the queue.
*It provides O(log(n)) time for add and poll methods.
*It inherits methods from AbstractQueue, AbstractCollection, Collection, and Object class.
