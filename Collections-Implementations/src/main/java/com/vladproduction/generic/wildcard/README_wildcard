Wildcards can be used in three ways −
Upper bound Wildcard − ? extends Type.
Lower bound Wildcard − ? super Type.
Unbounded Wildcard − ?

In order to decide which type of wildcard best suits the condition, let's first classify the
type of parameters passed to a method as -in and -out parameter.

-in variable − An in variable provides data to the code. For example, copy(src, dest). Here src acts
as in variable being data to be copied.

-out variable − An out variable holds data updated by the code. For example, copy(src, dest).
Here dest acts as in variable having copied data.

Guidelines for Wildcards.
Upper bound wildcard − If a variable is of in category, use extends keyword with wildcard.

Lower bound wildcard − If a variable is of out category, use super keyword with wildcard.

Unbounded wildcard − If a variable can be accessed using Object class method then use an unbound wildcard.

No wildcard − If code is accessing variable in both in and out category then do not use wildcards.
