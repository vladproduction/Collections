# 🔧 Data Structures Implementation in Java

This project showcases my custom implementation of commonly used **Java Collections** and **Data Structures**, built from scratch to deepen my understanding of core data handling concepts. It includes generic support and test coverage for most structures.

## 📚 Implemented Collections

| Collection Type | Description |
|-----------------|-------------|
| 👜 `Bag`         | Unordered collection allowing duplicates. Simple insert-only collection. |
| 📦 `ArrayList`   | Resizable array-based list supporting indexed access. |
| 🔗 `LinkedList`  | Doubly linked list with efficient insertions/removals. |
| 🗺️ `Map`         | Key-value mapping, similar to `HashMap`. |
| 🛒 `Queue`       | FIFO (First-In-First-Out) structure. |
| 🗂️ `Stack`       | LIFO (Last-In-First-Out) structure. |
| 🧬 `Generic`      | Generic interfaces and implementations for type flexibility. |
| 🔁 `Iterator`    | Custom iterator implementations for traversing data structures. |

## ✅ Tests Included

Unit tests have been written to validate functionality and ensure correctness:

- ✔️ `Bag` tests  
- ✔️ `ArrayList` tests  
- ✔️ `LinkedList` tests  
- ✔️ `Map` tests  
- ✔️ `Queue` tests  
- ✔️ `Stack` tests
